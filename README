This is code for the IRC bot that hangs around in #secretchronicles on
chat.freenode.net. It uses Cinch (https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch).

First, install all of its dependencies by running the following
commands in the project directory:

    # gem install --no-user-install bundler # only if not yet installed
    $ bundle install --path .gems

Now, run it:

    $ bundle exec ruby furbot.rb

If it refuses to start because some directories are missing or not
writable for the user running it, create those directories and make
them writable for the user under which you run furbot.

furbot logs to the syslog. If you need detailed debug logging, invoke
it with the -d option, which will make it dump the entire connection
stream to standard output.

    $ bundle exec ruby furbot.rb -d

There's also a systemd .service file provided that you might want to
adapt.
