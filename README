This is code for the IRC bot that hangs around in #secretchronicles on
chat.freenode.net. It uses Cinch (https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch).

First, install all of its dependencies (requires bundler):

    # gem install --no-user-install bundler # if not yet installed
    $ bundle install --path .gems

Now, run it:

    $ bundle exec ruby furbot.rb

furbot logs to the syslog. If you need detailed debug logging, invoke
it with the -d option, which will make it dump the entire connection
stream to standard output.

    $ bundle exec ruby furbot.rb -d

There's also a systemd .service file provided that you might want to
adapt.
