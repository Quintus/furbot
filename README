This is code for the IRC bot that hangs around in #secretchronicles on
chat.freenode.net. It uses Cinch (https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch).

First, install all of its dependencies (requires bundler):

    # gem install --no-user-install bundler # if not yet installed
    $ bundle install --path .gems

Now, run it as root:

    # bundle exec ruby furbot.rb -u furbot -g furbot -p /run

furbot immediately enters a chroot and drops root privileges,
switching to the user/group combination that was given via the -u and
-g options.

There's also a systemd .service file provided that you might want to
adapt.
